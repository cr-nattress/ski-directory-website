      "description": "Arizona Snowbowl is the Southwest's premier ski destination, located on the San Francisco Peaks—the highest mountains in Arizona at 12,633 feet. Just minutes from historic downtown Flagstaff, Snowbowl offers surprisingly challenging terrain with sweeping views that extend to the Grand Canyon on clear days. The resort has invested heavily in snowmaking infrastructure to supplement natural snowfall, ensuring consistent conditions throughout the season. Sacred to many Native American tribes, the mountain's beauty is matched by its cultural significance.",
