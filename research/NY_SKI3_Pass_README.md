## Notes

- “SKI3” often comes in multiple product flavors (season pass, frequent skier cards, etc.).
- Resort access (which mountains, how many days, blackout dates) depends on the specific product tier.
- This README focuses on the **core idea** that SKI3 links together **Belleayre, Gore, and Whiteface** under one umbrella.
