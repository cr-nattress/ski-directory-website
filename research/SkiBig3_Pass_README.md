# SkiBig3 Season Pass — Resort List

**Official info & purchase:** https://www.skibig3.com/season-passes/skibig3/

> The SkiBig3 pass covers the three major resorts in **Banff National Park**, Alberta, Canada.

## Included Resorts

- Banff Sunshine (a.k.a. Sunshine Village)
- Lake Louise Ski Resort
- Mt. Norquay

All three are based around the towns of **Banff** and **Lake Louise** in Alberta, Canada.

---

## Notes

- The same three resorts are consistently marketed as “SkiBig3”; what changes year-to-year are pricing, blackout dates (for some products), and partner benefits.
- This pass is region-specific but important in North American planning, since it often cross-markets with Ikon, Mountain Collective, and other products.
