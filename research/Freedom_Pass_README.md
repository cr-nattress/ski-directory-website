# Freedom Pass — Resort List

**Official info:** https://skifreedompass.com/  *(site may redirect or change; check from a member resort if needed)*

> ⚠️ Freedom Pass is a reciprocal network: you buy a season pass at a participating mountain and get 3 free days at the others (no blackout dates, historically). Partners and terms change, so always check your home mountain and the Freedom Pass page for the latest details.

## How Freedom Pass Works (conceptually)

- Hold a qualifying **season pass** at a Freedom Pass partner resort.
- Receive **three (3) free days** at each of the other Freedom Pass resorts.
- Typically **no blackout dates**, though always confirm for the current year.

## Notes

- The official skifreedompass.com site can be finicky to access via scripts; for humans, the link above or links from partner resorts are the best source of up-to-date information.
- Partners have changed over time; some older lists include additional New England and Midwest areas.
- Use this README as a structured reference for building tools; always sync against the current official list once per season.
