# Story 38.1: Research & Design UI/UX Approach

## Story
**As a** product owner
**I want** to research how other ski websites display resort stats in their headers
**So that** we can implement an industry-standard, user-friendly design

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document UI patterns from 5+ competitor sites:
  - OnTheSnow
  - SkiResort.info
  - Liftopia
  - EpicPass resort pages
  - Ikon Pass resort pages
  - Snow.com
  - ZRankings
- [ ] Identify common elements displayed in resort headers
- [ ] Propose 2-3 design options for the consolidated header
- [ ] Document mobile vs desktop considerations
- [ ] Create wireframes or mockups for preferred approach

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Trail Difficulty Visualization
- How do competitors show terrain breakdown?
- Colored bars vs pie charts vs simple percentages?
- Industry-standard colors (green/blue/black/double-black)?
- Size and prominence of the visualization?

### 2. Elevation Display
- Summit/Base/Vertical as separate items or combined?
- Use of mountain profile graphics?
- Formatting (12,504' vs 12,504 ft)?

### 3. Key Stats Prioritization
- Which 5-8 stats appear "above the fold"?
- Order of importance (what comes first)?
- Icon usage vs text labels?

### 4. Visual Design Patterns
- Horizontal strip vs grid layout?
- Background colors/contrast?
- Spacing and grouping of related stats?

### 5. Mobile Considerations
- Does the stat layout change on mobile?
- Collapsible sections?
- Horizontal scroll vs stack?

## Deliverables

1. **Competitor Analysis Document** (`research/competitor-analysis.md`)
   - Screenshots or references from each site
   - Pros/cons of each approach
   - Summary of best practices

2. **Design Options**
   - Option A: Horizontal stats strip below title
   - Option B: Stats grid with terrain chart
   - Option C: Compact icon-based stats row

3. **Recommendation**
   - Preferred design with rationale
   - Mobile wireframe
   - Desktop wireframe

## Priority
P1 - Must complete before implementation

## Effort
Medium (M)

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
- Focus on what works well for quick decision-making
- Consider that users are comparing multiple resorts
- Stats should be scannable in 2-3 seconds
