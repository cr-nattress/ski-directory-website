# Vision

## The Long-Term Vision

**Ski Resort Directory will become the definitive digital companion for every skier and snowboarder in North America.**

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Data Accuracy Over Speed
We will never sacrifice accuracy for being first. Users trust us because our data is reliable. When we're unsure, we say so. When sources conflict, we investigate.

### 2. User-First, Not Resort-First
We serve skiers, not resorts. We won't hide negative information, manipulate rankings for money, or prioritize partners over non-partners in search results. Monetization must never compromise user trust.

### 3. Comprehensive Over Curated
We include every resort, not just the famous ones. A small local hill with 200 vertical feet deserves representation alongside Vail. Lost ski areas deserve remembrance.

### 4. Open and Accessible
- Content should be accessible without login
- Core features should work without JavaScript
- Mobile experience should be first-class, not an afterthought
- Consider users with disabilities, slow connections, and older devices

### 5. Transparent About Sources
Users should know where our data comes from. We cite sources, show last-updated timestamps, and acknowledge uncertainty.

### 6. Respect the Ski Community
We're built by skiers, for skiers. We understand the culture, speak the language, and care about the sport's future. Environmental sustainability of ski areas matters to us.

## Competitive Landscape

### Current Players

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Our Differentiation |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **OnTheSnow** | Established brand, reviews | Cluttered, ad-heavy, outdated UX | Clean design, modern tech, faster |
| **OpenSnow** | Weather forecasting, conditions | Forecast-focused, not comprehensive | Broader data scope, better comparison |
| **Liftie** | Real-time lift status | Narrow focus (lifts only) | We integrate Liftie + everything else |
| **Ski Resort Stats** | Good data | Static, no real-time, poor UX | Dynamic, real-time, beautiful |
| **Individual resort sites** | Authoritative | Fragmented, self-promotional | Unified, unbiased, comparable |

### Our Competitive Moat

1. **Comprehensive Data Model**: We've invested in a schema that captures nuances others miss
2. **Multi-Source Aggregation**: We combine data others don't—Wikipedia, Wikidata, Liftie, weather APIs
3. **Pass Intelligence**: Deep understanding of pass structures and benefits
4. **Lost Ski Areas**: Historical data no one else maintains
5. **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js + Supabase enables features legacy platforms can't match
6. **SEO-First Design**: Structured for organic discovery from day one

## The Ski Resort Directory Difference

### We're Not Just Another Aggregator

Most ski sites are either:
- **Resort marketing sites**: Biased, promotional, isolated
- **Aggregators**: Generic, ad-cluttered, data-thin
- **Niche tools**: One feature (weather, lifts, reviews) without the whole picture

**We combine**:
- The depth of a resort's own site (stats, maps, amenities)
- The breadth of an aggregator (all resorts, comparable)
- The accuracy of specialized tools (real-time conditions)
- The usability of modern consumer apps (clean, fast, mobile-first)

### What Success Looks Like

> "I used to check three different sites before heading to the mountain. Now I just check Ski Resort Directory."
> — Target user testimonial

> "This is the Wikipedia of ski resorts, but actually useful."
> — Ski journalist

> "Finally, a site that treats ski data seriously."
> — Developer building on our API

## North Star Narrative

**In 5 years**, when someone discovers skiing for the first time, they'll find Ski Resort Directory. It will help them find a beginner-friendly local hill, track their progress as they improve, discover destination resorts for their first big trip, and eventually guide them to hidden gems across the continent.

**In 10 years**, our historical data will preserve the memory of resorts that close, our platform will have helped millions plan unforgettable trips, and the ski industry will see us as essential infrastructure for connecting skiers with mountains.

**We're not building a website. We're building the digital layer of the ski experience.**
